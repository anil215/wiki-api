instance methods works on documents ( rows) , here this is the individual document
model methods work on the collection ( tables ) , here this is the collction

we would be reusing the code to generate jwt's so instaed od copying it in POST /users
route we create reusable methods => model and instance methods , model methods are
called on the User object and instance method is called on the individual entity
(var entity = new User()) . Instance method , generateAuthToken method is responsible
for adding token to an individual document , saving that and returing the token to the
user. This requires the individual document to exist and hence created as an instance
method.Modal methods on the other hand do not require an individual document , example
findByToken(custom method , i will create ), take the jwt the user sends , we will find
the user and return that user.

This api is using my own custom header x-auth , which i need to send while posting a wiki,
deleting or updating a wiki and since this x-auth is nothing but the hashed value of the unique _id value of the user
this -auth token is unique.

Now for the x-auth token to work correctly , i need to create a middleware so that i can make
the create , delete , insert routes of wikis private , means accessed only when the user authenticates
himself.

The POST /users will be a public route for creating a user
The GET /users/me , used when the user has already signed up and is relogging.
    This performs the duty of sending the respective user back , _id and email.
    First grabs the x-auth token from request.
    Now use the model methods to find for this hashed token in the database
