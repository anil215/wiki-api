we would be reusing the code to generate jwt's so instaed od copying it in POST /users
route we create reusable methods => model and instance methods , model methods are
called on the User object and instance method is called on the individual entity
(var entity = new User()) . Instance method , generateAuthToken method is responsible
for adding token to an individual document , saving that and returing the token to the
user. This requires the individual document to exist and hence created as an instance
method.Modal methods on the other hand do not require an individual document , example
findByToken(custom method , i will create ), take the jwt the user sends , we will find
the user and return that user.

This api is using my own custom header x-auth , which i need to send while posting a wiki,
deleting or updating a wiki and since this x-auth is nothing but the hashed value of the unique _id value of the user
this -auth token is unique.
